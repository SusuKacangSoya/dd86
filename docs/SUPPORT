* OPERATING SYSTEM SUPPORT
***************************************

This page features a list of operating systems I wish to support. The higher
the tier, the likely the operating systems will receive new features and bug
fixes.

Getting DD-DOS to work on Windows and Linux is my main current priority.

First tier  | Windows (including ReactOS)
            | Linux
Second tier | FreeBSD
            | macOS (OS X)
            | OpenIndiana (based on OpenSolaris/Illios)
Third tier  | OpenBSD
            | NetBSD
            | HardenedBSD (based on FreeBSD)
            | DragonflyBSD [1]
            | Haiku [1] (based on BeOS)
Fourth tier | UEFI [2]

[1] The DMD install script mentions not supporting this operating system or script
    cannot run on the operating system. May include others untagged by this
    footnote.
    (Haiku) DMD version in the depot is 2.067.1, dating 2014.
    (DragonflyBSD) DMD in repo is 1.076_2, curl fails writing body.
[2] Requires a toolkit of which I may produce in the future.
